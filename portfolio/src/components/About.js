        A creative software engineer, I have been expanding what is possible
        with code in order to make life more efficient. I first became
        interested in software development during high school where I had make a
        website. After high school I went to study in Bachelor of Optometry and
        after I graduated from my college. All the while continue to learn about
        website designs on my own while in college. I work at an optical shop as
        an Optometrist for few years. But the job scope isn't have fulfilling as
        I thought it would be. So, I decided to go for software engineer
        bootcamp. Although I lack experiences, but my thrist for knowledge is
        what keep me motivated.
