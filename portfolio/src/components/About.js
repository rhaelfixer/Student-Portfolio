        A creative software engineer, I have been expanding with what is
        possible with code in order to make life more efficient. I first became
        interested in software development during high school where I had
        created a basic HTML website with CSS. After high school I went to study
        in Tun Hussein Onn National Eye Hospital and graduated with Bachelor of
        Optometry, all that whilst I continue to self-study about website
        designs while in college. I work at several optical shops as an
        Optometrist for few years but decided it is not for me. My true passion
        lies in coding, so I decided to change career path and took a
        accelerated computing course in software engineer with Bootcamp from
        General Assembly. I have now gain new competencies, skill and my
        portfolios is growing. I welcome any challenging opportunities as my
        thirst for knowledge is what keep me moving forward accomplishing more
        complex site requirements. My latest work is an affiliate program site
        based in the UK. I can work independently and remotely to get the job
        done. You can count on Rhael Fixer!
